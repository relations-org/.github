## Relations Corporation

Relations Corporation is a nonprofit engineering research and education organization developing better relationships between people, systems, and knowledge.

We build tools, models, and infrastructures that serve the public good—especially where existing institutions fall short.

# Mission

To advance scientific research, conceptual engineering, and public education by creating tools and frameworks that:

* Make complex systems legible and humane

* Amplify care, autonomy, and mutual understanding

* Repair the broken relationships between power, knowledge, and survival


# What We Do

Our work spans cognitive modeling, care tech, public health tooling, and epistemic infrastructure:

# Guiding Principles

 *   Care is infrastructure. Survival requires systems of mutual support, not isolated brilliance.

  *  Open knowledge, open code. We publish under permissive licenses and foster remixable tools.

   * Design for transformation. Systems should adapt to needs, not flatten them.

 *   Trust is earned through transparency. Every stakeholder, from volunteer to end user, deserves clarity.

# Collaborate With Us

We welcome:

 *   Researchers in cognitive science, AI, philosophy, and systems engineering

 *   Developers building mission-aligned tools

 *   Organizers and educators seeking ethical tech

 *   Students and thinkers looking for a home for their projects
